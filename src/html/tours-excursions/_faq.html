            What is the best time of year to visit the Amazon?
          </summary>

          <p>
            The Amazon can be visited year-round, but the dry season (June to November) is ideal for hiking and wildlife
            viewing, while the wet season (December to May) offers the best conditions for river cruises and canoeing.
